# quiz-taking-app

This tiny program was an assignment in FCI-CU@2019. This is a single-user multiple-quizzes/run program. The requested features were as follows:
- Load questions from file
- Add question using the program
- Questions are randomised each new quiz
- Answers are also randomised
- Update user's profile
- Error handling
- Ability to see all scores and score statistics

#### You have absolutely every right to use the code in this repo as your own but it would be more helpful to understand the concepts involved, why we did certain things in certain ways, and implementing them yourself instead of just copying. 

## V2 (In development)
Version 2.0.0 is underway. This will include whole new structure and an enhanced, performant search algorithm. It'll also include a collection of new features such as multiple users with different account types. 

## Contributing
Any addition or improvement is welcome. We're by no means experts at C++ and have probably made a few mistakes here and there. Just open an issue to discuss whatever you're trying to achieve and then open a PR whenever you please.
