### Structure

### How it all comes together

## Development Environment
- Codacy: For code style analysis
- Testing: We're still searching for a testing framework/platform to use. 

## V2
> In development
Version 2.0.0 is underway. This will include whole new structure and an enhanced, performant search algorithm. It'll also include a collection of new features such as multiple users with different account types. 

## Contributing
Any addition or improvement is welcome. We're by no means experts at C++ and have probably made a few mistakes here and there. Just open an issue to discuss whatever you're trying to achieve and then open a PR whenever you please.
